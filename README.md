# QGIS-SHP-County-Extractor
Given the United States County Line shape file (500k) from the Census 2018 data, this program will create KML files for each state in a designated folder. 

This is my first Python Project. Special thanks to Open Source Options on Youtube for the example code provided in the video below that assisted with my project:

Inputs: You must download the cb_2018_us_county_500k.zip on the 2018 Census Data, and open the shape file in QGIS.
